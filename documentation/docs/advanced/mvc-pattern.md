# Use MVC pattern
With model and View (with template engine) all that's missing is the controller.
Simply, [because of its philosophy](intro.md#philosophy), does not directly allow you to use the pattern.
But an extension has been created in order to have the magic of the Symfony controller in Simply.

## Install the extension
Coming soon.
