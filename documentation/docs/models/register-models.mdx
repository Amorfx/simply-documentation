# Register your model into Simply
After creating all of your models you have to register the models into Simply.

## Why ?
To inject automatically the good model with `ModelFactory`. The `ModelFactory` allows you to return the correct model according to the injecting object.
Like when you use hook you don't know which post type is the current object queried.
```php
<?php

global $post;

// $post->post_type is project
$project = ModelFactory::create($post);
// $project will be an instance of Project model after registered into Simply
```

## How ?
### By create a Simply framework extension
After [creating your simply extension](advanced/extended-simply.md) add the interface `RegisterModelInterface` to your extension class.
- Use the method `registerModel` to register your post type model and erase old configuration.
- Use the method `addPostModel` to register your post type model.
- Use the method `registerTermModel` to register your taxonomy model and erase old configuration.
- Use the method `addTermModel` to register your taxonomy model.
```php
<?php
class ThemePlugin implements PluginInterface, RegisterModelInterface {
    public function build(ContainerBuilder $container): void {}

    public function registerModel(ModelFactory $factory): void {
        $factory->registerPostModel([MyPostTypeClass::class, Post::class]);
        $factory->registerTermModel([MyTaxonomyClass::class]);
    }
}
```

### Deprecated method
With the good filter provides by Simply :
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="post-type" label="Post type">

```php
add_filter('simply/model/post_type_mapping', function(array $mapping) {
    $mapping[] = Project::class;
    return $mapping;
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="taxonomy" label="Taxonomy">

```php
// Add model for project tag
add_filter('simply/model/term_mapping', function(array $mapping) {
    $mapping[] = ProjectTag::class;
    return $mapping;
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `$mapping` array has basic object for post and category and tag. You can remove or replace it.
