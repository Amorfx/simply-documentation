# Register your model into Simply
After creating all of your models you have to register the models into Simply.

## Why ?
To inject automatically the good model with `ModelFactory`. The `ModelFactory` allows you to return the correct model according to the injecting object.
Like when you use hook you don't know which post type is the current object queried.
```php
<?php

global $post;

// $post->post_type is project
$project = ModelFactory::create($post);
// $project will be an instance of Project model after registered into Simply
```

## How ?
With the good filter provides by Simply :
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="post-type" label="Post type">

```php
add_filter('simply_model_post_type_mapping', function(array $mapping) {
    $mapping[] = Project::class;
    return $mapping;
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="taxonomy" label="Taxonomy">

```php
// Add model for project tag
add_filter('simply_model_term_mapping', function(array $mapping) {
    $mapping[] = ProjectTag::class;
    return $mapping;
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `$mapping` array has basic object for post and category and tag. You can remove or replace it.
:::caution
The name of the hook will change in future version of Simply Framework because of nomenclature. It will be `simply/model/post_type`.
