# Configure the service container
The main functionality is the addition of the Symfony container service. The configuration is done automatically on a plugin if you use `registerPlugin` function.

Otherwise you will have to configure manually with your yaml or php configuration files. [The official documentation can be found here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html). Please read it carefully and understand it otherwise you will have a hard time understanding the inner workings of the framework.
